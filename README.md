# Higher-kinded data in Scala 3

> Higher-kinded data (HKD) takes your existing data classes and wraps each field in a higher-kinded type, allowing you to do some funky things. I have recently seen a few presentations of this which piqued my interest sufficiently to try it out for myself. Given Scala 3 is just around the corner, I will use this as a chance to also try that out.

This is the accompanying repo to the post. All code is in `Person.scala`.
